It can cause premature aging, which is characterized by wrinkles, fine lines, and age spots. This is because UV radiation damages the collagen and elastin fibers in the skin, which are responsible for keeping it firm and elastic. Over time, this damage can lead to sagging skin and a loss of elasticity. 

Long-term exposure to UV radiation can also increase the risk of skin cancer. This is because UV radiation damages the DNA in skin cells, which can lead to mutations that can cause cancer. The most common types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.","Long-term exposure to UV radiation can have more serious effects on human skin.
