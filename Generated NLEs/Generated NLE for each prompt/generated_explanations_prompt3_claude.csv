Without bees, many plants cannot reproduce and will die off, leading to their extinction.', type='text')]",Prompt 3
Wind turbine farms kill so many birds including 150 eagles at one location and may cause the extinction of whale species. Acres of solar panels also kill birds and honeybees. These are not any better than using oil. We need new technologies.,"[TextBlock(text='Wind turbine noise disrupts whale navigation, causing strandings and population decline, risking extinction.', type='text')]",Prompt 3

Wearing a sunscreen of at least SPF 30 but ideally 50 protects your skin from this damage.","[TextBlock(text='Excessive UV exposure causes premature skin ageing by damaging collagen and elastin fibers in the skin.', type='text')]",Prompt 3
"Long-term exposure to UV radiation can have more serious effects on human skin. It can cause premature ageing, which is characterized by wrinkles, fine lines, and age spots. This is because UV radiation damages the collagen and elastin fibres in the skin, which are responsible for keeping it firm and elastic. Over time, this damage can lead to sagging skin and a loss of elasticity. Long-term exposure to UV radiation can also increase the risk of skin cancer. This is because UV radiation damages the DNA in skin cells, which can lead to mutations that can cause cancer.
