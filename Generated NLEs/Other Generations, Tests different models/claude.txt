Concept-set: [active volcanoes, cause, tsunami effect]
Generated

[TextBlock(text='Active volcanoes can cause tsunamis through a phenomenon known as the "tsunami effect." When an underwater volcano erupts, it can displace a massive volume of water, creating powerful waves that propagate outward from the source. The sudden displacement of water occurs because the explosive eruption releases a tremendous amount of energy, pushing the water upward and outward with great force. As the displaced water rushes away from the eruption site, it forms large, fast-moving waves that', type='text')]

These natural disasters have the potential to bring down power lines, damage transformers, and disrupt the electrical grid, leading to a widespread loss of utility services.

[TextBlock(text='The disruption of services and limited resources caused by damage to infrastructure can lead to an increase in deaths and injuries. When critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, water treatment plants, and power grids, is compromised, it can severely limit access to essential services and resources.

Generated

[TextBlock(text='The increased use of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, leads to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the use of fossil fuels.

Generated

[TextBlock(text='If bees were to go extinct, it would cause many plants to wither and die. Bees are essential pollinators for a wide variety of flowering plants. They transfer pollen from one flower to another as they collect nectar, enabling plants to produce fruits and seeds.
