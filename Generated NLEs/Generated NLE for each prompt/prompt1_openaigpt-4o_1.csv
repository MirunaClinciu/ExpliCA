"It is time that lifestyle choices be called out as often as the media calls out anti-vaccine sentiments. Obesity, lack of exercise, poor sleep, and sunshine avoidance are the true causes of most people's health issues but because people are lazy they just want a shot to fix them.","Obesity, lack of exercise, poor sleep, and sunshine avoidance lead to health issues due to lifestyle choices."
"Do you think?! This is like a no-brainer. This is why I'm so fucked up all the time, I don't sleep well at all. My therapist always says stressors and lack of sleep will cause mental health issues, she's been drilling it into me for years.","Stressors and lack of sleep disrupt brain function, leading to mental health issues."

There was a real concern when the pandemic hit that remote work was going to cause a drop in productivity.,Remote work initially caused a drop in productivity due to technological adaptation issues and communication barriers.
This was my main long-term concern about the pandemic. Remote work (a good thing) would cause more workers to flock to suburban and exurban sprawl (a bad thing). We need more space in our homes to be able to work there.,"Remote work increases home space needs, prompting suburban sprawl."
"As far as depression is concerned, Romo says, a multi-country review of studies measuring remote work’s impact on mental health for the 20 years prior to the pandemic indicated that remote work itself does not cause depression.",Remote work doesn't cause depression; other factors like isolation or stress might contribute.

That's not true. The largest cause of homelessness is poverty and the largest causes of poverty are shitty or no jobs and poor education. You don't really get a say in where you grow up going to school or what the job market looks like.,Poverty causes homelessness due to lack of resources from inadequate jobs and education.
Social media has also made an impact by causing viral news stories. It can be bad for the industry because some stories that go viral are not accurate and can cause misinformation. It has also caused disruptions to the traditional business model of journalism.,"Social media amplifies stories, spreading misinformation rapidly, disrupting journalism's traditional fact-checking processes."

It’s the same way as how rainbows are made from sunlight and sprinkled with water.","Uranium's structure scatters UV light, causing wavelength shift to visible green."
"A fogbow is a rainbow that appears as a bow in fog rather than rain, and due to the very small size of water droplets that cause fog, it has only very weak colours or appears as white.","Fogbows form because the very small size of water droplets in fog scatters light differently, producing weak or white colors."
Fun fact: we get goosebumps when we’re cold cause the hair muscles contract.,Goosebumps occur because hair muscles contract when we're cold.

"Long-term exposure to UV radiation can have more serious effects on human skin. It can cause premature ageing, which is characterized by wrinkles, fine lines, and age spots. This is because UV radiation damages the collagen and elastin fibres in the skin, which are responsible for keeping it firm and elastic. Over time, this damage can lead to sagging skin and a loss of elasticity. Long-term exposure to UV radiation can also increase the risk of skin cancer. This is because UV radiation damages the DNA in skin cells, which can lead to mutations that can cause cancer. The most common types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.","Long-term UV exposure damages skin fibers, leading to premature ageing."
"As you age, your body naturally makes less collagen. This would cause sunken eyes and deeper wrinkles. You will have to get Radiesse fillers or the like to help smooth out the wrinkles.","As you age, decreased collagen production leads to sunken eyes and deeper wrinkles."
"Toxins that accumulate for a long time in the body not only cause you to get acne but also cause your skin to age quickly, causing dark circles and puffiness under the eyes.

Accurate measurements have shown that heating comes first and CO2 concentrations increase later. Henry's law explains how a rise in temperature will cause CO2 to be released from the oceans. Rise in temperature is caused by proximity to the Sun which is cyclical in nature.,"The rise in temperature is caused by Earth's cyclical proximity to the Sun, releasing CO2 from oceans."
"Plants need sun (light) to stay alive, grow, and reproduce, but increasing it may cause leaves to dry out and damage them. If this excess energy remains in plant cells, it causes (damages) in molecules called free radicals can hurt proteins and important cellular molecules.",Increasing sunlight causes leaves to dry out and damage by creating excess energy that forms harmful free radicals.
