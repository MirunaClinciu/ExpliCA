"It is time that lifestyle choices be called out as often as the media calls out anti-vaccine sentiments. Obesity, lack of exercise, poor sleep, and sunshine avoidance are the true causes of most people's health issues but because people are lazy they just want a shot to fix them.","Poor lifestyle choices like obesity, lack of exercise, poor sleep, and sunshine avoidance lead to various health issues."
"Do you think?! This is like a no-brainer. This is why I'm so fucked up all the time, I don't sleep well at all. My therapist always says stressors and lack of sleep will cause mental health issues, she's been drilling it into me for years.",Stressors and insufficient sleep impair mental health by exacerbating anxiety and depression.
